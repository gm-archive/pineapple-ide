For the development version of Sabre a hack was put into Core so it also looks for a ../Plugins folder.
To set up plugins correctly do the following:

1. Create a Sabre/Trunk/Core/Plugins folder if it doesn't already exist.
2. Put Symbolic Links for the following.
Apple_Pie.jar -> ...Sabre/Trunk/Apple Pie/dist/Apple_Pie.jar
Game_Plugin_2D.jar -> ...Sabre/Trunk/Game Plugin 2D/dist/Game_Plugin_2D.jar
Pineapple.jar -> ...Sabre/Trunk/Pineapple/dist/Pineapple.jar
Syntax_Highlighter.jar -> ...Sabre/Trunk/Syntax Highlighter/dist/Syntax_Highlighter.jar
Resources.jar -> ...Sabre/Trunk/Resources/dist/Resources.jar
mydoggy-api-1.5.0.jar
mydoggy-plaf-1.5.0.jar
mydoggy-res-1.5.0.jar
TableLayout-bin-jdk1.1-2007-04-21.jar

You can just copy the 4 libraries at the bottom from Pineapple/dist/lib.
Additional Plugins can be added in the same manner.
Also, you should svn:ignore the Plugins folder like so:
$ svn propedit svn:ignore Sabre/Trunk/Core/Plugins
then enter * hit then CTRL+O enter and CTRL+X
Do this because Symbolic Links don't commit through Subversion too well.
